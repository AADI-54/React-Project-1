React Practice Project
This project was created as a way to practice my skills and become more comfortable with React. It helped me explore the basics of the React framework and improve my front-end development workflow by integrating Tailwind CSS for styling. Additionally, I utilized some pre-built designs and assets to focus more on coding and functionality.

Purpose
The goal of this project is to:

->Learn and practice React concepts such as components, state, and props.
->Get familiar with JSX syntax.
->Implement Tailwind CSS for responsive design and custom styling.
->Use pre-built designs and assets to enhance the user interface without spending too much time on custom design.

Technologies Used:
->React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
->Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework for styling.
->Pre-built Designs and Assets: Used to quickly prototype and enhance the visual aspects of the project.

How to Run:
->Clone the repository.
->Run npm install to install dependencies.
->Run npm run dev to start the development server.
